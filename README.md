# Rusty

Hello future me and other snooping developers.

This is a personal reference for my Rust journey. You might learn a thing or two.

## Data Types

### Compound Types

#### Arrays

Fixed size list of the same type. Type is specified as `<type; size>`.

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```

## Appendix

Crate
